				<h3>SPECIALS CONDITIONS</h3>
				<p>The Owner and the Charterer accept that Clauses 1-25 inclusive form part of this agreement which consists 
				of 9 pages plus any conditions shown above or addenda attached. Signed and legible facsimile copies of this 
				agreement shall be binding.</p>
				<h4>1. AGREEMENT TO LET AND HIRE</h4>
				<p>The OWNER agrees to let the Vessel to the CHARTERER and not to enter into any other 
				Agreement for the Charter of the Vessel for the same period.</p>
				<p>The CHARTERER agrees to hire the Vessel and shall pay the Charter Fee, the Advance Provisioning Allowance,
				the Delivery/ Re-delivery Fee, the Security Deposit and any other agreed charges, in cleared funds, 
				no later than the dates and to the Account specified in this Agreement.</p>
				<h4>2. DELIVERY</h4>
				<p>The OWNER, shall at the beginning of the Charter Period deliver the Vessel free of encumbrance to the Place
				of Delivery in compliance with its flag state requirements and the CHARTERER shall take delivery in full 
				commission and working order. The Vessel shall be insured, seaworthy, clean, in good condition throughout 
				and ready for service, with full equipment, including up to-date safety and lifesaving equipment (including 
				life-jackets for children if any are carried in the CHARTERER’s Party), as required by the Vessel’s 
				registration authority and fitted out as appropriate for a Vessel of her size and type and enabling the 
				CHARTERER to use the Vessel as set out in Clause 13. The OWNER does not warrant her use and comfort in bad 
				weather conditions for all cruises or passages within the Cruising Area.</p>
				<h4>3. RE-DELIVERY</h4>
				<p>The CHARTERER shall re-deliver the vessel to the owner at the place of Re-delivery free of any debts 
				incurred for the CHARTERER'S account during the Charter Period and in as a good condition as when delivery 
				was taken, except for fair wear and tear arising from ordinary use. The CHARTERER may, if he wishes 
				Re-Deliver the vessel to the place of re-delivery and disembark prior to the end of the charter period 
				but such early re-delivery shall not entitle the charterer to any refund of the charter fee.</p>
				<h4>4. CRUISING AREA</h4>
				<ol type="a">
				<li>The CHARTERER shall restrict the cruising of the vessel to within the cruising area and to within 
				regions in the cruising area in which the vessel is legally permitted to cruise. The CHARTERER shall 
				also restrict time under way to an average of six (6) hours per day, unless the captain at his sole 
				discretion, agrees to exceed this time.</li>
				<li>While the Captain and /or Broker will make all reasonable efforts to accommodate the charterers request 
				for a berth; it is understood that the Captain and /or Broker and /or Stakeholder (if applicable) cannot 
				be held liable for the non-allocation of the berth.</li>
				</ol>
				<h4>5. MAXIMUM NUMBER OF PERSONS - RESPONSIBILITY FOR CHILDREN - HEALTH OF THE CHARTERER'S PARTY</h4>
				<ol type="a">
				<li>The CHARTERER shall not at any time during the Charter Period permit more than the maximum number of 
				guests sleeping or cruising on board plus, at the sole discretion of the Captain, a reasonable number of 
				visitors whilst the vessel is securely moored in port or at anchor, or as permitted by the appropriate 
				authority.
				<li>If children are taken on board, the CHARTERER shall be fully responsible for the conduct and entertainment 
				and no member of the crew shall be held responsible for their conduct or entertainment.</li>
				<li>The nature of a charter may render it uncomfortable or unsuitable for anybody with physical disability or 
				undergoing medical treatment. By signature of this Agreement the CHARTERER warrants the medical fitness of 
				all the members of the CHARTERERs Party for the voyage contemplated by this agreement. The Charterer and his 
				party undertake to have all necessary visas and vaccinations for the countries to be visited.</li>
				</ol>
				<h4>6. CREW</h4>
				<ol type="a">
				<li>The OWNER shall provide a Captain qualified in accordance with the vessels flag state requirement and 
				acceptable to the insurers of the vessel. He shall also provide a suitably qualified and properly 
				trained crew. No member of the crew shall carry or use any illegal drugs on board the vessel or 
				keep any firearms on board (other than those declared in the manifest) and the captain and crew 
				shall comply with the laws and regulations of any country into whose waters the vessel shall enter 
				during the course of this agreement.
				<li>It is understood that the crew are entitled to a minimum amount of rest in accordance with the Vessel’s 
				code of practice, which includes the Maritime Labour Convention (MLC) 2006.</li>
				<li>The Captain and Crew are bound at all times to keep all information related to this Charter, the OWNER, 
				the CHARTERER, and all Guests as confidential and no information is to be disclosed to any third party 
				without prior permission in writing.</li>
				</ol>
				<h4>7. CAPTAIN’S AUTHORITY AND RESPONSIBILITIES</h4>
				<ol type="a">
				<li>The OWNER shall ensure that the Captain shows the CHARTERER the same attention as if the CHARTERER were 
				the OWNER. The Captain shall comply with all reasonable orders given to him by the CHARTERER regarding the 
				management, operation and movement of the Vessel, wind, weather and other circumstances permitting. The 
				Captain shall not, however, be bound to comply with any order which might result in the Vessel moving 
				to any port or place that is not safe and proper, or might result in the CHARTERER failing to re-deliver 
				the Vessel upon the expiration of the Charter Period, or would, in the reasonable opinion of the Captain, 
				cause a breach of Clause 13 and/or any other clause of this Agreement. Further, without prejudice to any 
				other remedy of the OWNER, if, in the reasonable opinion of the Captain, the CHARTERER or any of his 
				Guests fail to observe any of the provisions in Clause 13 and if such failure continues after the 
				Captain has given due and specific warning to the CHARTERER in writing in respect of the same, the 
				Captain shall inform the OWNER, the Broker and the Stakeholder, and the OWNER may terminate the Charter 
				forthwith or instruct the Captain to return the Vessel to the Place of Re-Delivery and upon such return 
				the Charter Period shall be terminated. The CHARTERER and his Guests shall disembark, the CHARTERER having 
				settled all outstanding expenses with the Captain beforehand and the CHARTERER shall not be entitled to 
				any refund of the Charter Fee.</li>
				<li>With particular regard to the use of watersports equipment, the Captain shall have the authority to 
				exclude the CHARTERER or any or all of his Guests from use of any particular watersports equipment if 
				they are unsafe, or behaving in an irresponsible manner, or are under the influence of alcohol, or are 
				failing to show clue concern for other persons or property when operating this equipment.</li>
				</ol>
				<p>NOTIFICATIONS BY THE CAPTAIN: The Captain shall immediately notify the Broker and Stakeholder of any 
				breakdowns, disablements, crew changes, accidents, or other significant incidents that occur during the 
				Charter Period.</p>
				<h4>8. OPERATING COSTS</h4>
				<ol type="a">
				<li>The Charter Fee includes the charter of the Vessel with all its equipment in working order; tools; stores;
				cleaning materials and basic consumable stores for engine room, deck, galley and cabins; laundry of ship’s 
				linen; the crew’s wages, uniforms and food; the insurance of the Vessel and crew as per Clause 16. The 
				CHARTERER will pay, at cost, for all other expenses. These include, but are not limited to, shoreside 
				transport; fuel for the main engines and generators; fuel for tenders and water sports equipment; food 
				and all beverages for the Charter Party; berthing dues and other harbour charges including pilots’ fees, 
				local taxes, divers’ fees, customs formalities and any charges for waste disposal, charges for water and 
				electricity taken from shore; ships’ agents’ fees where applicable; personal laundry; Charter Party 
				communications and internet use; and hire or purchase costs of any special equipment placed on board at 
				the CHARTERER’s request.</li>
				</ol>
				<p>Payment for extraordinary expenses such as special requirements or equipment, shoreside transport or 
				excursions or any other expenses not customarily considered part of the Vessel’s operating costs may be 
				required to be paid, via the Broker’s account in advance or to the Captain on boarding, in addition to 
				the APA.</p>
				<p>Having paid the Advance Provisioning Allowance (APA) via the Broker’s Account, the CHARTERER shall be 
				advised by the Captain, at intervals, as to the disbursement of the APA and shall, if the balance remaining 
				becomes insufficient in the light of current expenditure, pay to the Captain a sufficient sum to maintain 
				an adequate credit balance. The OWNER shall ensure the Captain will exercise due diligence in the 
				expenditure of the APA. Any charges or fees related to the transfer of the APA to the Vessel are for the 
				CHARTERER’s account. Exchange rates, if applicable, cannot be guaranteed.</p>
				<p>Prior to disembarkation at the end of the Charter Period, the Captain shall present to the CHARTERER a 
				detailed account of expenditure, with as many supporting receipts as possible, and the CHARTERER shall pay 
				to the Captain the balance of the expenses or the Captain shall repay to the CHARTERER any balance overpaid, 
				as the case may be.</p>
				<p>Payment by cheque, credit card or other negotiable instrument is not normally acceptable due to the 
				itinerant nature of the Vessel’s seasonal schedule and the CHARTERER should therefore ensure that he has 
				sufficient funds available to cover all foreseeable expenses or arrange to deposit additional funds with 
				the Broker.</p>
				<h4>9. DELAY IN DELIVERY</h4>
				<ol type="a">
				<li>If, by reason of force majeure (as defined in Clause 18 (a)), the OWNER fails to deliver the Vessel to 
				the CHARTERER at the Place of Delivery at the commencement of the Charter Period and delivery is made within 
				forty-eight (48) hours of the scheduled commencement date, or within one tenth (1/1 Oth) of the Charter 
				Period, whichever period is the shorter, the OWNER shall pay to the CHARTERER a refund of the Charter Fee 
				at a pro rata daily rate or if it be mutually agreed the OWNER shall allow a pro rata extension of the 
				Charter Period.</li>
				
				<h5>FAILURE TO DELIVER</h5>
				
				<li>If by reason of force majeure the OWNER fails to deliver the Vessel within forty-eight (48) hours or a 
				period equivalent to one-tenth (1/10th) of the Charter Period, to the Place of Delivery, whichever period 
				is the shorter from the due time of delivery, the CHARTERER shall be entitled to treat this Agreement as 
				terminated. The CHARTERER’s exclusive remedy will be to receive immediate repayment without interest of 
				the full amount of all payments made by him under the terms of this Agreement. Alternatively, if the parties 
				mutually agree, the Charter Period shall be extended by a time equivalent to the delay or postponed to a 
				mutually agreed time.</li>
				<li>If the OWNER fails to deliver the vessel at the place of delivery at the commencement of the charter period 
				other than by reason of force majeure; the CHARTERER shall be entitled to treat this Agreement as Repudiated 
				by the OWNER. The CHARTERER will be entitled to immediate repayment without interest of the full amount of 
				all payments made by him under the terms of this agreement and shall in addition be paid by the OWNER 
				liquidated damages of an amount equivalent to fifty percent (50%) of the charter fee.</li>
				
				<h5>CANCELLATION BY OWNER</h5>
				<li>If prior to the commencement of the charter period as set out in page one of this agreement, the owner 
				tenders notice of cancellation via the broker and if the cancellation is by reason of force majeure, the 
				remedy in (b) above shall apply.</li>
				<li>If the cancellation is for any reason, other than force majeure, the charterer shall be entitled to 
				immediate repayment without interest of the full amount of the payments made by him under the terms of this 
				agreement and shall in addition be entitled to liquidated damages from the owner to be calculated and paid 
				forthwith on the following scale:
					<ol type="i">
						<li>Thirty (30) days or more before commencement of the charter period, and amount equivalent to 
						Twenty-Five percent (25%) of the charter fee.</li>
						<li>More than fourteen (14) days but less than thirty (30) days before commencement of the charter period, 
						an amount equivalent to thirty five percent (35%) of the charter fee.</li>
						<li>Fourteen (14) days or less before commencement of the charter period, an amount equivalent to fifty 
						percent (50%) of the charter fee.</li>
					</ol>
				</li>
				</ol>
				<h4>10. DELAY IN RE-DELIVERY</h4>
				<ol type="a">
					<li>If re-delivery of the vessel is delayed by reason of Force Majeure, re-delivery shall be affected as 
					soon as possible thereafter and in the meantime the conditions of this Agreement shall remain in force but 
					without penalty or additional charge against the CHARTERER.</li>
					<li>If the CHARTERER fails to re-deliver the vessel to the owner at the place of re-delivery due to intentional 
					delay or change of itinerary against the Captain's advice, then the CHARTERER shall pay forthwith to the 
					owner via the broker/stakeholder's account demurrage at the daily rate plus fifty percent (50%) of the 
					daily rate. The CHARTERER shall be liable for all operating costs as per Clause 8 and indemnify the 
					owner for any loss or damage which the owner shall suffer by reason of deprivation of use of the vessel 
					or cancellation of, delay in delivery under any subsequent charter of the vessel.</li>
				</ol>
				
				<h4>11. CANCELLATION BY CHARTERER & CONSEQUENCES OF NON-PAYMENT</h4>
				<ol type="a">
					<li><br/> 
						<ol type="i">
							<li>Should the CHARTERER give notice of cancellation of this agreement on or at any time before 
							the commencement of the charter period, some or all of the charter fee may be retained by the 
							owner determined as follows:<br/>
							* After this agreement is signed but before the final instalment is due to be paid, the owner 
							shall be entitled to retain the first instalment.<br/>
							* After any subsequent instalments are due to be paid, the owner shall be entitled to retain the 
							first instalment and any subsequent instalments due.<br/>
							If any of the instalments are due to be paid but have not been paid then the OWNER shall have 
							a claim against the CHARTERER for the amount so due.</li>
							<li>DEFAULT OF PAYMENT OR FAILURE TO PAY<br/>
							Should the CHARTERER fail to pay, after having been given written notice by the OWNER, any amount 
							due under this Agreement, the OWNER reserves the right to treat this Agreement as having been 
							repudiated by the CHARTERER and to retain the full amount of all payments and to recover all 
							sums unpaid and due up to the date of the repudiation.</li>
							<li>Notwithstanding the OWNER’s right to receive or retain all payments referred to above, 
							the OWNER shall be under a duty to mitigate the CHARTERER’s loss and in the event, that the 
							OWNER is able to re-let the Vessel for all or part of the Charter Period under this Agreement, 
							the OWNER will give credit for the net amount of charter hire arising from such re-letting 
							after deduction of all commissions and other consequential expenses arising from such 
							re-letting. The intention is that the OWNER shall receive the same in net proceeds from 
							any re-letting as would have been received under this Agreement had it not been cancelled 
							or repudiated, so that the OWNER shall reimburse or forgive payments received or due from 
							the CHARTERER only to the extent that the net proceeds from any re- letting which corresponds 
							to part or all of the Charter Period exceed the amounts which would have been received under 
							this Agreement. The OWNER shall use his best endeavours to re-let the Vessel and shall not 
							unreasonably withhold his agreement to re-let, although charters which may reasonably be 
							considered detrimental to the Vessel, its reputation, its Crew or its schedule may be refused.</li>
							<li>If, prior to the date of cancellation, the Vessel has taken on provisions for the Charter, 
							or has utilised the Delivery/Re-delivery fee as set out on Page One of this Agreement, then the 
							CHARTERER shall pay for these expenses unless all or part can be either refunded by the supplier 
							or transferred to the next Charter, in which case they shall be adjusted accordingly. The 
							Captain and OWNER shall be under a duty to mitigate these expenses where possible.</li>
							</ol>
						</li>
						<li>If, after signature of this Agreement, the OWNER is adjudged bankrupt or, in the case of a 
						company, a liquidator, receiver or administrator is appointed over all or part of the OWNER’s 
						assets, the CHARTERER shall be entitled to cancel the Charter and all monies paid to the OWNER, 
						his agent or the Stakeholder pursuant to this Agreement shall be refunded without further deduction.</li>
				</ol>
				<h4>12. BREAKDOWN OR DISABLEMENT</h4>
				<p>If after delivery the Vessel shall at any time be disabled by breakdown of machinery, grounding, collision 
				or other cause so as to prevent reasonable use of the Vessel by the CHARTERER for a period between 
				twelve (12) and forty-eight (48) consecutive hours or one tenth (1/10th) of the Charter Period, whichever 
				is the shorter (and the disablement has not been brought about by any act or default of the CHARTERER) 
				the OWNER shall make a pro rata refund of the Charter Fee for the period of the disablement or, if mutually 
				agreed, allow a pro rata extension of the Charter Period corresponding with the period of disablement. 
				If the CHARTERER wishes to invoke this clause he shall give immediate notice to the Captain directly, 
				(or via the Broker). The CHARTERER shall not be liable for extra costs relating to the immobilisation 
				of the Vessel but will remain liable for normal expenses during the period of disablement.</p>
				<p>In the event of the actual or constructive total loss of the Vessel or if the Vessel is disabled as 
				aforesaid for a consecutive period of more than forty-eight (48) hours or one tenth (1/10th) of the 
				Charter Period, whichever is shorter, the CHARTERER may terminate this Agreement by notice in writing 
				to the OWNER via the Brokers or to the Captain if no means of communication is available. Within two (2) 
				working days after such termination, the Charter Fee shall be repaid by the OWNER pro rata without 
				interest for that proportion of the Charter Period outstanding after the date and time on which the 
				loss or disablement occurred. In the event of such termination the CHARTERER may affect re-delivery 
				by giving up possession of the Vessel where she lies. The CHARTERER shall be entitled to recover from the 
				OWNER the reasonable cost of returning the CHARTERER and his Guests to the Place of Re-Delivery together 
				with reasonable accommodation expenses incurred.</p>
				<p>Alternatively, after a consecutive period of disablement of more than forty-eight (48) hours or one tenth 
				(1/10th) of the Charter Period, whichever the shorter, and dependent on the nature and seriousness of the 
				disablement, by mutual agreement the CHARTERER may elect to remain on board for the duration of the 
				Charter Period and the CHARTERER will then have no further or additional claim against the OWNER.</p>
				<h4>13. USE OF THE VESSEL</h4>
				<p>The CHARTERER shall comply, and shall ensure that the Guests comply, with the laws and regulations of any 
				country into whose waters the Vessel shall enter during the course of this Agreement.</p>
				<p>The CHARTERER shall ensure that no pets or other animals are brought on board the Vessel without the 
				consent in writing of the OWNER.</p>
				<p>The CHARTERER shall ensure that the behaviour of the CHARTERER and his Guests shall not cause a nuisance 
				to any person or bring the Vessel into disrepute. The Vessel is not to be used for commercial photo or film 
				shoots of any nature, unless by written permission from the OWNER.</p>
				<p>The CHARTERER and Guests shall afford the Crew due respect at all times. No Crew member shall be subjected 
				to any type of harassment, sexual or otherwise, by the CHARTERER or Guests at any time during the Charter 
				Period.</p>
				<p>Unless otherwise agreed, smoking shall be restricted to the exterior areas of the Vessel designated by 
				the Captain.</p>
				<p>Rendezvous diving only unless otherwise noted under Special Conditions.</p>
				<p>The Captain shall promptly draw the CHARTERER’s attention to any infringement of these terms by himself 
				or his Guests, and if such behaviour continues after this warning, the Captain shall inform the OWNER or 
				Stakeholder, and the OWNER may, by notice in writing given to the CHARTERER, terminate this Agreement in 
				accordance with Clause 7.</p>
				<p>If the CHARTERER or any of the Guests shall commit any offence contrary to the laws and regulations of 
				any country which results in any member of the Crew of the Vessel being detained, fined or imprisoned, or 
				the Vessel being detained, arrested, seized or fined, the CHARTERER shall indemnify the OWNER against all 
				loss, damage and expense incurred by the OWNER as a result, and the OWNER may, by notice to the CHARTERER, 
				terminate this Agreement forthwith.</p>
				<p>The Vessel operates a zero-tolerance policy and the possession or use of any illegal drugs or any weapons 
				(including firearms) is strictly prohibited on board the Vessel. Failure to comply shall be sufficient reason 
				for the OWNER to terminate the Charter forthwith without refund or recourse against the OWNER, Stakeholder 
				or Broker.</p>
				<h4>14. NON-ASSIGNMENT</h4>
				<p>The CHARTERER shall not assign this Agreement, sub-let the Vessel or part with the control of the Vessel 
				without the consent in writing of the OWNER, which consent may be on such terms as the OWNER thinks fit.</p>
				<h4>15. SALE OF THE VESSEL</h4>
				<ol type="a">
					<li>The OWNER agrees not to sell the vessel during the Charter Period as set out on page one of this 
					Agreement.</li>
					<li>Should the OWNER agree to sell the vessel after the signing of this Charter Agreement, but before
