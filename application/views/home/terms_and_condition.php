                    <h3>Terms & Conditions of our Rental</h3>
                    <p>Accepting our terms and conditions or putting a signature on the agreement, shall be considered as an 
                        evidence of your acceptance of our terms & conditions. These terms and conditions shall apply to all the 
                        bookings you make through Immidia’s website. Therefore, if you do not agree with any constituent of these 
                        conditions, you must not under any circumstances proceed with the booking. And upon your confirmation that 
                        you wish to book a car, a yacht, a villa or a private jet through this website, you acknowledge thereby, 
                        that you have read, understood and accepted these terms and conditions.</p>
                    <p>When you rent a Private Jet on this website, the booking may be accepted within 2 hours of your 
                        application. GSM team shall notify you by email or by telephone and will send you a booking confirmation 
                        if your application is accepted. If you have any queries in this regard, please do not hesitate to 
                        contact us.</p>
                    <h3>Information Accuracy</h3>
                    <p>Immidia aims to protect the reliability of the information found on our website but neither we, nor our 
                        service providers can be held responsible for the reliability of such information. It is solely your 
                        responsibility to assess the reliability, completeness, and usefulness of all information/data provided on 
                        this website.</p>
                    <h3>IMPORTANT INFORMATION</h3>
                    <p>Customer must check carefully the insurance details provided by our local service provider. It is not 
                        uncommon for third party insurance to exclude family members or relatives who travel with you. If your 
                        travel insurance does not include such coverage, you can request for a supplementary insurance from our 
                        local service providers. We recommend you to take note of the extent of the protection provided on the 
                        insurance and if necessary, to purchase additional coverage for your spouse, children or relatives who 
                        accompany you.</p>
                    <h4>Deposits & Fuel policy</h4>
                    <p>Our service providers will ask for a deposit at the start of the rental period to cover fuel costs, 
                        deductible liability and other expenses incurred during the rent. Customer must provide a valid credit 
                        card that must be in the name of the main driver. This deposit will be returned upon return of the vehicle 
                        provided that the vehicle is returned in the same condition as when rented.(Please note that this deposit 
                        amount will be released within a period of 14 days).</p>
                    <p>If our service providers provide the vehicle with a full fuel tank, customer must return it with full 
                        tank; otherwise the customer will be charged for the cost of the fuel. The rental company charges you higher 
                        price for fuel, than a local petrol station.</p>
                    <h4>Min/Max age for rental</h4>
                    <p>The client must be 21 years old to rent a car/jet/villa/yacht. There may be extra charges for drivers 
                        aged under 25 and over 65 with certain service providers and in certain countries. Please check with our 
                        GSM team if you have queries about this matter.</p>
                    <p>Daily rate calculation/Rental time and Extension of Car/Villa/Yacht Rental Period.</p>
                    <p>Rentals are calculated by periods of 24 hours in case of car or villa and 10 hours in case of a yacht. 
                        If you wish to extend the rental period of a car/yacht villa, or return it later than the date mentioned on 
                        your booking confirmation, you need to contact our local service provider, who will charge accordingly and 
                        which is subject to availability.</p>
                    <h4>Early Returns.</h4>
                    <p>The rental duration is calculated according to the dates mentioned on your booking confirmation. If the 
                        vehicle is returned earlier or taken later than expected date and time, the amount will not be refunded. 
                        Customer must contact us if he/she is unable to take the car at the time and date agreed upon.</p>
                    <h4>Personalized Services.</h4>
                    <p>Additional services such as child seats, roof racks and additional equipment are available on request 
                        with most of our service providers, although they are not guaranteed. These accessories are subject to extra 
                        charges payable to our local service provider at the time of rental. Customer must book the additional 
                        services at the time of booking.</p>
                    <h4>Delivery & Collection of Car/Yacht</h4>

                        free of charge.</p>
                    <h4>Car, Jet, and Yacht Driving/Flying Areas</h4>
                    <p>Restrictions may be applicable when booking to a different country/state/island; our GSM team must 
                        therefore be instructed at the time of booking whether the customer intend to do this. If you wish to 
                        travel to the restricted counties, additional documentation may be required and local charges may apply.</p>
                    <h4>How to modify your booking?</h4>
                    <p>You shall change your booking before the rental, provided that the duration remains the same and that our 
                        service provider has the required availability. For further enquiries please contact our GSM team.</p>
                    <h4>Cancellation Terms</h4>

                    </ul>
                    <h4>Cancellation by Immidia</h4>
                    <p>Immidia may cancel/change/relocate your booking on a very rare occasion. As soon as we make any changes 
                        to your booking, you will be notified. We will make all efforts to relocate your booking. Full refund will 
                        be made if you do not accept the alternate option.</p>
                    <h4>Yacht Rentals Cancellation:</h4>
                    <p>If you wish to cancel the charter agreement at any time before the commencement of the Charter, some or 
                        all of the charter fee may be retained by the service provider determined as follows:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>The service provider may retain the 1st instalment after the charter agreement is signed but before the 
                            final instalment is due to be paid.</li>
                        <li>The service provider may retain the first instalment and any subsequent instalments due.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <h4>Documentation required for the rental</h4>
                    <p>Customer must carry a copy of booking confirmation, full valid national driving license and other 
                        identification documents that are required.</p>
                    <h4>Driving License</h4>
                    <p>The drivers must have valid driving license held for at least 1 year. Every driver must present their 
                        license when collecting a rental car. They must also keep their driving license with them at all times 
                        during the rental period, for perusal by local authorities. An International Driving Permit does not 
                        replace the requirement for a regular driving license. If you use an international driving license, a 
                        full driving licensee in the main driver’s name will still be required in order to rent the car.</p>
                    <h4>Car Class & Car Capacity</h4>

                        our application for the information about the capacities of the various car classes. Immidia will not 
                        accept responsibility of rental refusal by the service provider because of the number of passengers 
                        compared to the size of the vehicle.</p>
                    <h4>Car Provisions.</h4>
                    <p>Our service providers hold the right to deny a car to any customer who is deemed unfit to drive or is 
                        not eligible. Immidia is not going to be liable for the travel arrangements, for any refund, compensation 
                        or any other costs the customer, may have to pay in such a case.</p>
                    <h4>Complaints</h4>
                    <p>If you are malcontent in any way with our service, please address this to the service provider and our 
                        GSM team which will be available for you to find a solution. If you wish to make a complaint, please ensure 
                        you contact our GSM team within 3 months of completion of the rental.</p>
                    <h4>Accidents/Mechanical Difficulties</h4>
